Save interesting Youtube comments! This extension adds a save button next to the author of each comment in a Youtube video's comment section. When clicked, the extension extracts the text from the comment along with a link to the video the comment was from to the extensions popup window in the chrome extension toolbar. This extension was created to allow Youtube users to save comments they like and might want to read again much like people save youtube video's to a playlist. There is a lot of useful information buried in the comment sections of Youtube and this extension gives a way to catalog it. 

## Installation
1. Clone this repo or download the zip file
2. Visit chrome://extensions/ and turn on Developer Mode
3. Click load unpacked in the top lefthand corner and select the folder downloaded from github
